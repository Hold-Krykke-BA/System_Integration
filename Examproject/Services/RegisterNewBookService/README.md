## Service Description

Initialized with:

- Spring Boot DevTools
- Lombok
- Spring Web (if we are using REST for addBook)
- Spring HATEOAS
- Spring Data MongoDB (for MongoDBREpository)
- Spring Web Services (for SOAP)
- Netflix Eureka Discovery Client

External SOAP API was manually discovered through [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/Szf26WHn#58604e5a-7631-43dc-8ed4-904f4223d59b).  
The API and its WSDL file is hosted [here](http://webservices.daehosting.com/services/isbnservice.wso) and is fetched remotely on project build execution.

### Generating SOAP 
The SOAP consumer is generated by the jaxb2.maven2 plugin. It executes during the maven `compile` lifecycle.

Hint: If your IDE is set up to execute maven during build, it may be enough just to build the project. Otherwise:  
- If maven is installed globally, run `mvn compile` - or:  
- If using IntelliJ, build the project and run the `compile` lifecycle found in the Maven sidebar menu - or:  
- Maven is included wrapped, so you should be able to run `./mvnw compile` or a variant of it.  

Upon execution you should find the files generated in `target/classes/holdkrykke/registernewbookservice/services/soap/consumingwebservice/wsdl`.
