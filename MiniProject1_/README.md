## About

In short, the three services cover the following areas:
- gRPC: Studypoints & text file data storage
- SOAP: Consumes a SOAP API related to scientific articles. Output in console.
- REST: Provides an API of students and their grades. Stored in a H2 in-memory database.

Each subfolder contains its own part of the project.

## REST
This part of the application provides an API and data store containing students and their grades.

The application was built with Spring Boot and supported by Maven, H2 and JPA. It is extended by the h2 console and the HAL explorer.

### Installation
Dependencies are installed by Maven through the `pom.xml` file.

1) Build project
2) Run `RestApplication.java`
3) Browse the API and database. Query it using the HAL-explorer or Postman.

### Data stores
The application uses the H2 in-memory database as a datastore. The database contains some testdata which is loaded by Spring through the `LoadDatabase.java` class.

        },
        {
