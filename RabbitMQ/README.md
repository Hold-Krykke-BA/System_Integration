## Description

The customer application:  
- makes a loan requests to multiple banks;
- collects non-binding bank quotes from (simulated) bank applications;
- compares the quotes and selects one, based on its own financial status and
criteria


## Overview

A simple overview of our understanding can be seen here:  
![Mockup of conceptual understanding](/Concept.png)

We decided to only implement RabbitMQ due to time constraints and for not having seen Apache Camel integrated with RabbitMQ yet in class.

An application lender should provide the following to the banks through the client:
- Loan topic (car OR house)
- Loan amount
- Loan time
- Credit score

The banks will then respond whether they are interested or not, and if so, their rates.

### The client
There is one client that requests several banks. The client can be found in [/Client](./Client).

### The banks (Consumers)
There are several banks that respond to the client. The bank can be found in [/Bank](./Bank).  
The banks should be loaded several times for simulating several banks and responses.
